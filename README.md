# Kaggle_Titanic
Just trying out methods.

The python file follows the guided tutorial given on Kaggle.com, with a little more messing around by myself. 

The R file is my own code, taken from a homework problem, and applied to the Titanic dataset. It uses logistic regression, fitted
using a penalized likelihood. The MLE of the likelihood is found using the EM algoithm, and iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS)
to maximize.
